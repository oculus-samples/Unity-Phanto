    When building mixed
    reality experiences, evaluate your content from a health and safety perspective
    to offer users a comfortable and safe experience. Please read the [Mixed Reality
    H&S Guidelines](https://developer.oculus.com/resources/mr-health-safety-guideline/)
    before designing and developing your app using this sample project or any of
    our Presence Platform features.


    ## Avoiding Improper Occlusion


    Avoid
    improper occlusion, which occurs when virtual content does not respect the physicality
    of the user''s environment. Improper occlusion can result in a misperception
    of actionable space.


    - See [Occlusions with Virtual Content](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/resources/mr-health-depth#occlusion-with-virtual-content)

    -
    Ensure users have completed Space Setup and granted [Spatial Data permission](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-spatial-data-perm/)
    to allow proper occlusion in content placement, mesh collisions, and air navigation.


    ##
    Using Semi-Transparent Content


    Using semi-transparent content lets users
    better view their physical space and reduces the occlusion of objects or people
    not part of the scanned mesh.


    - Spatial data won''t incorporate dynamic
    elements of a user''s living space (e.g., a chair moved after capture or a moving
    person/pet in the space).

    - Uncaptured dynamic elements may be occluded
    by virtual content, making it more difficult for users to safely avoid such hazards
    while engaged in the mixed reality experience.


    ## Personal Space Guidelines


    Respect
    the user''s personal space. Avoid having virtual content pass through their body
    or loom close to their face. When content crosses into a user''s personal space,
    they may experience psychological or visual discomfort or take actions to avoid
    the virtual content that may increase the risk of injury or damage.


    - [PersonalBubble.cs](../Assets/Phanto/Player/PersonalBubble.cs)
    is an example of how to implement a "personal bubble" as part of the nav mesh.
    Add this script to the player camera rig to prevent Phanto from getting too close
    to it.

    - The circumference of the ''personal bubble'' may be altered to
    provide more space. The faster that virtual content approaches a user, the larger
    the circumference may need to be tuned.
