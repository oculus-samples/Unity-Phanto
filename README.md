# Project Phanto - Presence Platform Reference App

![Phanto Banner](./Media/PhantoTitle.png "Phanto")

# Project overview
Project Phanto is a Unity reference app, showcasing the latest Presence Platform features, highlighting scene mesh, Scene Model, and Scene API objects

The [scene mesh](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-scene-mesh/) is a low-fidelity, high-coverage artifact which describes the boundary between free and occupied space in a room. It is generated automatically during the Space Setup experience, and available for applications to query via Scene API.

## Requirements
- Recommended Unity version: 2022.16f1
- Mac or Windows
- Unity OVR Integration package v60 (included in the project)

# Health and safety guidelines
When building mixed reality experiences, we highly recommend evaluating your content from a health and safety perspective to offer your users a comfortable and safe experience. Please read the [Mixed Reality H&S Guidelines](https://developer.oculus.com/resources/mr-health-safety-guideline/)  before designing and developing your app using this sample project, or any of our Presence Platform features.

Developers should avoid improper occlusion, which occurs when virtual content does not respect the physicality of the user’s environment. Improper Occlusion can result in a mis-perception of actionable space.

- See [Occlusions with Virtual Content](https://developer.oculus.com/resources/mr-health-safety-guideline/#passthrough)

- To avoid  improper occlusion, developers should ensure that users have (1) completed Space Setup and (2) granted Spatial Data permission (setup design) to allow proper occlusion  in content placement, mesh collisions, and air navigation.

Using semi-transparent content lets the user have a better view of their physical space and reduces the occlusion of objects or people that are not part of the scanned mesh.

- Spatial data won’t incorporate dynamic elements of a user’s living space (for example,  a chair that was moved after capture or a moving person/pet in the space).

- Uncaptured dynamic elements may be occluded by virtual content, making it more difficult for a user to safely avoid such hazards while engaged in the mixed reality experience.

Respect the user’s personal space. Avoid having virtual content pass through their body or loom close to their face. When content crosses into a user’s  personal space they  may experience a psychological or visual discomfort, or take actions to avoid the virtual content that may increase the risk of injury or damage  (for example, backing up into a wall or chair). Dynamic virtual content may also distract the user from their surroundings.

- [PersonalBubble.cs](./Assets/Phanto/Player/PersonalBubble.cs) is an example of how to implement a "personal bubble" as part of the nav mesh. Add this script to tha plater camera rig to prevent Phanto from getting too close to it.
- The circumference of the ‘personal bubble’ may be altered to provide more space. The faster content that virtual content approaches a user, the larger the circumference may need to be tuned.

# Design flow
The following diagrams represent the game's main user flow.
<br><br>

## Setup design
Prior to starting the game, the setup flow will verify the user has:
* Completed **Space Setup** and has a Scene Model
* Granted **Spatial Data** permission ([implementation instructions](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-spatial-data-perm/))

Without these two requirements, the application can't function. Therefore, the user will only be able to advance to the next scene after complying with these requirements.

```mermaid

graph TD;
    Lobby-->SpaceSetup;
    SpaceSetup-->Lobby;
    Lobby-->Permission;
    Permission-->Lobby;
```

When permission is denied, or if no Scene Model is present, the user will be presented with prompts that allow them to rescan their room and grant permissions.

:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![RescanScene](./Media/NoSceneModel.png "Missing scene prompt") | ![PermissionPrompt](./Media/PermissionPrompt.png "Permission Prompt")

<br><br>

## Gameplay design

The following diagram shows the high-level states for the player after they have fulfilled the requirements above. When launching the game for the first time, the player will go through a tutorial. Afterward, the tutorial can be skipped.

```mermaid

```

<br><br>

## Developer examples
These example scenes are available for developers. They showcase best practices with each of the Presence Platform components.

# Key components
The game demonstrates our recommended best practices when using the new scene mesh feature and updated Scene API.

<br>

## The Scene Mesh
The [scene mesh](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-scene-mesh/) is provided in the project and is accessed using **OVRSceneManager**. Each one of the sample scenes will create an **OVRSceneManager** component and automatically load the mesh and room elements captured during the space setup flow. The scene mesh will be represented as a standard Unity mesh. It can contain a collider, and will respond to raycasts. In the project, the scene mesh will be assigned the **GlobalMesh** layer mask.

For more information on how to get started with scene mesh, visit [Meta Quest Developer Portal](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-scene-overview/)

<br><br>

## The Ectofluid (Ghostly Goo)
![Goo GIF](./Media/Goo.gif "Goo")

The Ectofluid is a ghostly goo, created both by Phanto and their Phantoms. Beware: once your room gets too covered with goo, you lose the game.

This element demonstrates the ability to place virual content onto the physical environment represented by the scene mesh. With this new ability, content can be attached anywhere within the room reconstruction, adjusting itself to the real physical environment.

<br><br>

## The Polterblast 3000
![Polterblast image](./Media/Hose.png "Hose")

This element demonstrates the use of the scene mesh as a physics component. This allows the fluid to collide with the mesh, and creates a splashing effect. We recommend using particles with fast collisions to create a more immersive experience.

- Use the Polterblast 3000 to throw Ectofluid and clean the ghostly goo from your room.
- Press the Right Trigger  to throw Ectofluid
<br><br>

## Phanto and the Phantoms
![Phanto and Phantoms image](./Media/PhantoPhantoms.png "Phanto and Phantoms")

Watchout! Some Phantoms are appearing in your room. Use the Polterblast 3000 (RT) and the Ecto Blaster (LT) to defeat all of them.

- Phanto is an air-navigated NPC that uses the scene mesh as a sensor to figure out available places, both to navigate to, and to spawn virtual elements onto (Ectofluid).
- The Phantoms are small, ground-navigated NPCs that use both the scene mesh and the room capture data (chairs, couch, desk, windows, etc.) to navigate across the environment, jump to targeted places, and spawn content (Ectofluid).

<br><br>

## Ecto Blaster
![Blaster image](./Media/Blaster.png "Blaster")

The Ecto Blaster is allows you to defeat the Phantoms. Place it in your room and it will target and throw Ectofluid at them. To place the Ecto Blaster, point to any location in your room and press the Left Trigger. This element demonstrates the ability to trace and raycast against the environment, using the scene mesh as a raycast layer. This allows the user to create and place virtual content in mixed reality that responds to the scene.

<br><br>

# Getting started

## Prerequisites
1. Clone the project using:
`git clone https://github.com/oculus-samples/Unity-Phanto`
2. Recommended Unity version - 2022.16f1.

## Using the project's scenes

After opening the project, you will find three main scenes and seven example scenes:

### Main Scenes
1. [LobbyScene.unity](Assets/Phanto/Scenes/LobbyScene.unity): this self-contained scene contains the introduction scene, showing the current mesh, and allows the player to start the game.
2. [TutorialScene.unity](Assets/Phanto/Scenes/TutorialScene.unity): contains the tutorial for the player, presenting the controls and game dynamics.
3. [GameScene.unity](Assets/Phanto/Scenes/GameScene.unity): this self-contained scene contains the assets for the actual gameplay. This includes Phanto, the Phantoms, and other assets.

### Example Scenes

1. [ContentPlacement.unity](Assets/Phanto/Scenes/Features/ContentPlacement.unity): contains an example that uses the mesh for content placement. The example takes the Blaster from the game and demonstrates how to use the mesh to place it anywhere in the room.
2. [MeshCollisions.unity](Assets/Phanto/Scenes/Features/MeshCollisions.unity): demonstrates using the mesh for physics. Using fast collisions, the recommended way, the Ectoplasma bounces off the mesh and creates a realistic experience.
3. [AirNavigation.unity](Assets/Phanto/Scenes/Features/AirNavigation.unity): demonstrates how to use the scanned mesh as a sensor for an air-navigated character (Phanto).
4. [MeshNavigation.unity](Assets/Phanto/Scenes/Features/MeshNavigation.unity): demonstrates how to use the mesh for ground navigation, with and without additional bounding box information on the furniture (acquired using manual capture of the room elements).
5. [SceneVisualization](Assets/Phanto/Scenes/Features/SceneVisualization.unity): a debug scene that presents the mesh and the furniture bounding box, if available.
6. [DebugDrawingScene](Assets/Phanto/Scenes/Features/DebugDrawingScene.unity): a debug scene that showcases some of the developer debug tools.
7. [UserInBounds](Assets/Phanto/Scenes/Features/UserInBounds.unity): shows the recommended handling of notifying the user whrn leaving the scene bounds.

<br><br>

# Running the project:

In general, all scene data (both in headset and in Editor) is managed by the [**SceneDataLoader.cs**](./Assets/Phanto/Environment/Scripts/SceneDataLoader.cs) script, interacting with the **OVRSceneManager** prefabs:

![SceneDataLoader.cs](./Media/SceneDataLoader.PNG "SceneDataLoader.cs")

There are three options for running the project.

## Using a Quest 3
Build, deploy, and run the game on your headset.

## Using Oculus Link (Only on Windows):
1. Open the Oculus app.
1. Run Oculus Link from the headset.
1. Run Unity using the **Play** button.
    Make sure you select **Scene Api** as the **Scene Data Source** in the [**SceneDataLoaderSettings.asset**](./Assets/Phanto/SceneDataLoaderSettings.asset) scriptable object:

    ![SAtatic mesh on image](./Media/SceneDataLoaderStaticMeshOff.png "Static Mesh")

***NOTE**: Scene mesh and room elements will show up in Link. However, you can only trigger room scan from within the headset. Please do it beforehand.*

## Using static mesh
This option will load a pre-scanned mesh in-editor, or in the headset. This allows development without a Scene Model on the headset.

To enable this, you need to select **Static Mesh Data** as the **Scene Data Source** in the [**SceneDataLoaderSettings.asset**](./Assets/Phanto/SceneDataLoaderSettings.asset) scriptable object:

![Static mesh off image](./Media/SceneDataLoaderStaticMeshOn.png "Static Mesh")

If you are on Windows, enable [XR Simulator](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/xrsim-intro/), and press **Play**.

<br><br>

# Main scenes
## LobbyScene

This scene functions as an introductory scene for the player. The player can view their scene, scan it, and change it. If no scene information is provided, the player will be guided to the **Space Setup** flow. If there is scene information for the current environment, the player can advance to one of these three options:

1. [TutorialScene](#TutorialScene): starts the tutorial for the player.
2. [GameScene](#GameScene): starts the game for the player.
3. Trigger **Space Setup**: using the left trigger, the player can restart the **Space Setup** process, allowing them to rescan the environment in case something has changed.

Rescan Scene            |  Start Game
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![RescenScene](./Media/LobbyScene1.PNG "Rescen Scene") | ![StartGame](./Media/LobbyScene2.PNG "Start Game")
<br><br>

## TutorialScene
The tutorial scene introduces the player to game mechanics. In this scene, the player will learn how to:

- Use the Polterblast 3000.
- Place the Ecto Blaster.
- Shoot and interact with Phantoms.

When running the app for the first time, the tutorial is mandatory. Afterward, the player will have the option to repeat the tutorial, or jump right into the game.

In this scene, you can find examples of how some sub-components (excluding Phanto) are used in the game. In addition, a set of controller-locked UI screens can be found here. As with other scenes, the tutorial scene also uses the scene mesh and scene elements, managed by the **SceneDataLoader** component.

Welcome |  Polterblast  |  Ecto Blaster  |  Phantoms  |  Start Game
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:

<br><br>

## GameScene
![Game Controls](./Media/GameControls.png "Controls")

This scene includes prefabs for the main game components:
- Phanto
- Phantoms
- Polterblast 3000
- Ecto Blaster

You can use the scene in standalone mode and run it using Oculus Link, or by building and deploying it to your device.

All of the game components are present in this scene, and restarting the game is as simple as reloading the scene. In addition, you can find debug features within the scene, that can be enabled using the **Menu** button on the left controller.

Within the scene, you can find the **SceneDataLoader** component, which takes care of loading the mesh and scene information. Other components in the scene are used to manage sound, GUI alerts, runtime assets, and game events.

<br><br>


# Example scenes

## ContentPlacement
![Content Placement](./Media/ContentPlacement.gif "Content Placement")
[ContentPlacement.unity](Assets/Phanto/Scenes/Features/ContentPlacement.unity) contains an example that uses the mesh for content placement. The example takes the Blaster from the game and shows how to use the mesh to place it anywhere in the room.

<br><br>

## Mesh Collisions
![Mesh Collisions](./Media/MeshCollisions.gif "Mesh Collisions")

[MeshCollisions.unity](Assets/Phanto/Scenes/Features/MeshCollisions.unity) demonstrates using the mesh for physics. Using fast collisions, the recommended way, the Ectoplasma bounces off the mesh and creates a much realistic expertience.

<br><br>

## Air Navigation
![Air Navigation](./Media/AirNavigation.gif "Air Navigation")

[AirNavigation.unity](Assets/Phanto/Scenes/Features/AirNavigation.unity) shows how to use the scanned mesh as a sensor for an air navigated character (Phanto).

<br><br>

## Mesh Navigation
![Mesh Navigation](./Media/MeshNavigation.gif "Mesh Navigation")

[MeshNavigation.unity](Assets/Phanto/Scenes/Features/MeshNavigation.unity) shows how to use the mesh for ground navigation, with and without additional bounding box information on the furniture (acquired using manual capture of the room elements).

<br><br>

## Scene Visualization
![Scene Visualization](./Media/SceneVisualization.gif "Scene Visualization")


[SceneVisualization.unity](Assets/Phanto/Scenes/Features/SceneVisualization.unity) is a debug scene that presents the mesh and the furniture bounding box, if available.


<br><br>

## Debug Drawing Scene
![Debug Scene](./Media/DebugDrawScene.gif "Debug Scene")

[DebugDrawingScene.unity](Assets/Phanto/Scenes/Features/DebugDrawingScene.unity) is a debug scene that showcases some of the developer debug tools.

<br><br>

## User In Bounds
![User In Bounds](./Media/UserInBounds.gif "User In Bounds")

[UserInBounds.unity](Assets/Phanto/Scenes/Features/UserInBounds.unity) demonstrates best practices for the app to handle cases in which the user is outside the scene. When leaving the scene bounds, the user should be notified and presented with an option to rescan the space. [InsideSceneChecker.cs](./Assets/Phanto/Samples/Scripts/InsideSceneChecker.cs) is attached to the camera prefab and notifies the app when either the user head or hands is inside/outside the bounds, using [SceneBoundsChecker.cs](./Assets/Phanto/Environment/Scripts/SceneBoundsChecker.cs)
